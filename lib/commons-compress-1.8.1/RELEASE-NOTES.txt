Release 1.8.1

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o COMPRESS-272:  CompressorStreamFactory can now auto-detect Unix compress
                 (".Z") streams. 

Fixed Bugs:
o COMPRESS-270:  The snappy, ar and tar inputstreams might fail to read from a
                 non-buffered stream in certain cases. 
o COMPRESS-277:  IOUtils#skip might skip fewer bytes than requested even though
                 more could be read from the stream. 
o COMPRESS-276:  ArchiveStreams now validate there is a current entry before
                 rreading or writing entry data. 
o ArjArchiveInputStream#canReadEntryData tested the current
                 entry of the stream rather than its argument. 
o COMPRESS-274:  ChangeSet#delete and deleteDir now properly deal with unnamed
                 entries. 
o COMPRESS-273:  Added a few null checks to improve robustness. 
o COMPRESS-278:  TarArchiveInputStream failed to read archives with empty
                 gid/uid fields. 
o COMPRESS-279:  TarArchiveInputStream now again throws an exception when it
                 encounters a truncated archive while reading from the last
                 entry. 
o COMPRESS-280:  Adapted TarArchiveInputStream#skip to the modified
                 IOUtils#skip method. Thanks to BELUGA BEHR. 

Changes:
o The dependency on org.tukaani:xz is now marked as optional.
